# Notes

- Extract Function
  - clarify what this code block does e.g. calculate amount for one performance  
  - prone to change e.g. play type may increase in near future  
  - check variables that go beyond scope which should be passed as parameters 
  - determine what to return  
- Always run test after any small change, thus automate it  
- Rename variables  
  - write Human-readable code  
- Change temporary variable into for-function e.g. get play from performance
- Inline variable  
- Change function declaration
